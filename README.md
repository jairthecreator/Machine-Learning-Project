# Machine-Learning-Project
I selected a dataset from Kaggle focusing on symptoms and characteristics indicative of early signs of diabetes among individuals. By exploring these observations, my goal was to uncover potential relationships among these symptoms and their correlation with testing positive or negative for diabetes.

The dataset comprised of 521 observations, encompassing 17 distinct variables related to individuals and their symptomatic profiles indicative of potential diabetes diagnoses. Within these variables, one was numerical while the rest were categorical. Minimal adjustments were made, primarily capitalizing column titles for consistency. The dataset did not have any missing values, so imputation was not necessary. This project utilized two machine learning algorithms: decision tree classification and association rules. These methods were implemented to extract more insight and obtain valuable information from this dataset.

The initial method employed was the decision tree classification algorithm. Decision tree classification was specifically chosen for its ability to display relationships among various variables within a hierarchical framework, while also displaying key features that may be crucial for predicting a diabetes diagnosis. The strength of this method lies in its capability to prioritize key symptoms and establishing decision nodes based on their importance in making accurate predictions.

The analysis began by initializing my 'X' variables, which included all observations except for 'Class', alongside the 'y' variable representing ‘Class’ or the classification of diabetes. This approach was able to distinguish the variables influencing the classification of diabetes positively or negatively. Given the numerous categorical variables, a conversion to dummy variables was necessary to for functionality of the decision tree classification. In this context, a value of “1” denotes an individual testing positive for diabetes, while a value of “0” signifies a negative result for diabetes. Also, the model was further evaluated by assessing its accuracy, which yielded 91.3%. This high accuracy displays the effectiveness of the model in analyzing the dataset. I also utilized a confusion matrix to provide a comprehensive overview of the model's performance, revealing 31 true positives, 7 false positives, 2 false negatives, and 64 true negatives. The dataset was partitioned into training and testing subsets, with an 80/20 split ratio with a maximum depth of three, indicating the decision tree was divided three times, yielding seven final nodes. The root node pertained to individuals exhibiting polydipsia or excessive thirst (<=0.5). By examining the leftmost branch, if an individual did exhibit polydipsia, it was followed by another node determining whether the individual also experienced polyuria or excessive urination. If confirmed, the following decision focused on if the individual is a male. In the event of a male gender, the final node or leaf node signaled a classification of '1', indicating a positive diagnosis for diabetes. Upon closer examination of the branches within the decision tree, it becomes apparent that six out of the seven leaf nodes suggest indications of individuals testing positive for diabetes based on other observations.
The next machine learning method I implemented is association rules. This method was utilized with the aim of uncovering correlations and associations among the provided symptoms or characteristics. Its output can unveil not only indicators leading to a positive or negative diagnosis of diabetes but also to unveil any hidden relationships or patterns within the dataset.

The association rules machine learning algorithm began by utilizing the same dataset and creating a new data frame focusing on half of the categorical variables. This approach was due to RAM constraints encountered during execution. Next, dummy variables were generated to represent these observations numerically. Following this, the Apriori algorithm was applied to identify frequent itemsets that revealed associations or co-occurrences among the symptoms under analysis. The algorithm also factored in lift, with a minimum confidence level of 0.5, as its metric due to its effectiveness in gauging the strength of association between different variables. The output revealed a variety of diverse itemsets, which one stood out with a notable lift of 3.62. A lift higher than 1 is a strong indication of the consequents occurring based on the antecedents. In this particular itemset, the antecedent comprising of individuals that do not experience diabetes, sudden weight loss, and visual blurring may also be devoid of polyuria (excessive urination), polydipsia (excessive thirst), delayed healing, obesity, particularly among males. Additional analysis could be conducted to explore further relationships and their interconnections among other observations. 

In this study, I analyzed a dataset focusing on early signs of diabetes among individuals using decision tree classification and association rules algorithms. Through decision tree classification, I identified key symptoms associated with diabetes diagnosis, notably, polydipsia and polyuria emerged as significant indicators. Additionally, association rules mining unveiled a variety of intricate associations among different symptoms. Overall, this study highlights
